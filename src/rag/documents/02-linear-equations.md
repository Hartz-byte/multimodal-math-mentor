# Linear Equations (Algebra)

## Overview
Linear equations are fundamental building blocks of algebra. They appear in systems, parametric equations, and as simplifications of complex problems. Mastering linear equations is essential.

## KEY FORMULAS

### Standard Form
$$ax + b = 0, \quad a \neq 0$$

### Solution
$$x = -\frac{b}{a}$$

### Linear Function
$$y = mx + c$$
where $m$ is slope, $c$ is y-intercept

### Point-Slope Form
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

### Two-Point Form
$$\frac{y - y_1}{y_2 - y_1} = \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

## SOLUTION PATTERN

1. **Simplify both sides**: Combine like terms
2. **Move variable to one side**: Use addition/subtraction
3. **Isolate variable**: Use multiplication/division
4. **Verify solution**: Substitute back to check

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Simple Linear Equation
**Problem**: Solve $3x - 9 = 0$

**Solution**:
- $3x = 9$
- $x = \frac{9}{3} = 3$

**Verification**: $3(3) - 9 = 9 - 9 = 0$ ✓

### Example 2: Linear with Fractions
**Problem**: Solve $\frac{x}{2} + 3 = 7$

**Solution**:
- $\frac{x}{2} = 4$
- $x = 8$

## CONSTRAINTS
- $a \neq 0$ for unique solution
- Domain restrictions based on context

## WATCH OUT

❌ **Wrong**: Not performing same operation on both sides
✅ **Correct**: Always maintain equation balance

❌ **Wrong**: Sign errors when moving terms
✅ **Correct**: Changing operation sign when moving across equals

❌ **Wrong**: Forgetting to apply operation to entire side
✅ **Correct**: Distribute operations properly

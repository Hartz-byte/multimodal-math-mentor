# Basic Operations: Fractions, Decimals, Percents (Arithmetic)

## Overview
Foundational arithmetic involves converting between fractions, decimals, and percentages, and understanding ratio and proportion. These are tools for comparing quantities.

## KEY CONCEPTS & FORMULAS

### Fractions to Decimals
Divide numerator by denominator.
*   $\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$
*   $\frac{1}{3} = 0.333\dots$

### Percentages
"Per cent" means "per 100".
*   $x\% = \frac{x}{100}$
*   Percentage Change: $\frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Original Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \times 100$

### Ratios
Comparison of two quantities $a$ and $b$, written $a:b$ or $\frac{a}{b}$.
*   $a:b :: c:d \iff \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ (Proportion)
*   Product of means = Product of extremes ($b \times c = a \times d$)

## SOLUTION PATTERNS

### Converting Repeating Decimal to Fraction
Example: Convert $x = 0.333\dots$
1.  Let $x = 0.333\dots$ (eq 1)
2.  Multiply by 10 (since 1 repeating digit): $10x = 3.333\dots$ (eq 2)
3.  Subtract eq 1 from eq 2: $9x = 3$
4.  $x = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$

### Solving Percentage Problems
"Find patterns":
*   "What percent of A is B?" $\rightarrow \frac{B}{A} \times 100$
*   "A is 20% more than B" $\rightarrow A = 1.20 \times B$
*   "A is 20% less than B" $\rightarrow A = 0.80 \times B$

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Compound Ratios
**Problem**: If $A:B = 2:3$ and $B:C = 4:5$, find $A:B:C$.
**Solution**:
*   Make the common term ($B$) equal in both ratios.
*   LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.
*   Multiply first ratio by 4: $A:B = 8:12$
*   Multiply second ratio by 3: $B:C = 12:15$
*   Combined: $A:B:C = 8:12:15$

### Example 2: Successive Percentage Change
**Problem**: Number increased by 10%, then decreased by 10%. Net change?
**Solution**:
*   Let number = 100.
*   Increase 10%: $100 + 10 = 110$.
*   Decrease 10% of 110: $110 - 11 = 99$.
*   Net change: $100 \rightarrow 99$. (1% decrease).
*   Formula: $x + y + \frac{xy}{100}$ (where decrease is negative).
    *   $10 - 10 + \frac{10(-10)}{100} = -1\%$

## COMMON MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Adding Fractions incorrectly
❌ **Wrong**: $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}$
✅ **Correct**: Find LCM of denominators: $\frac{ad + bc}{bd}$

### Mistake 2: Denominator in Percentage Change
❌ **Wrong**: Dividing by New Value instead of Original Value.
✅ **Correct**: Always divide by the **Original (Base) Value**.

### Mistake 3: Ratio Order
❌ **Wrong**: treating $2:3$ same as $3:2$.
✅ **Correct**: Order matters.

## TIPS FOR JEE
1.  **Approximation**: Learn values like $\frac{1}{6} \approx 16.66\%$, $\frac{1}{7} \approx 14.28\%$.
2.  **Componendo & Dividendo**: For proportions $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \Rightarrow \frac{a+b}{a-b} = \frac{c+d}{c-d}$.
3.  **Unit Consistency**: Ensure quantities in ratio have same units.

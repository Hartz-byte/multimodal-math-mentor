# Polynomials, Factors, and Remainder Theorem

## 1. Polynomials
A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables.
Example: $P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 1$

## 2. Factor Theorem
The **Factor Theorem** is a result in algebra usually linking factors and zeros of a polynomial.
**Theorem**: A polynomial $P(x)$ has a factor $(x - k)$ if and only if $P(k) = 0$.

### Example Problem
**Problem**: Find the value of $k$ if $x - 1$ is a factor of $x^3 - kx^2 + x + 2$.
**Solution**:
1. Since $x - 1$ is a factor, we set $x = 1$.
2. By Factor Theorem, $P(1) = 0$.
3. Substitute $x=1$ into equation: $(1)^3 - k(1)^2 + (1) + 2 = 0$.
4. Simplify: $1 - k + 1 + 2 = 0 \implies 4 - k = 0 \implies k = 4$.

## 3. Remainder Theorem
The **Remainder Theorem** states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial $P(x)$ by a linear polynomial $(x - k)$ is equal to $P(k)$.

## 4. Solving for Variables
When asked to find a variable (like $a$ or $k$) given a factor condition:
1. Identify the value to substitute (e.g., for factor $x-a$, substitute $x=a$).
2. Substitute this value into the polynomial equation.
3. Set the result to 0 (since remainder is 0).
4. Solve the resulting equation for the variable.
